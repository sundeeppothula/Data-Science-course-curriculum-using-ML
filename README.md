# Data-Science-course-curriculum-using-ML

As the use of data science and analytics spread across industries, demand for qualified individuals increases. The steps to becoming qualified as a data science professional, however, are not so clearly defined. Compared to a field such as law, data science as a study is in its infancy. Without the time (centuries in the case of law) to hone course curriculums or program structures, educators must move quickly to meet the growing demand.

As such, this consultation Project for the University of Toronto focuses on designing the following:

(1) a graduate level data science and analytics course curriculum

(2) a technically focused data science graduate program curriculum

(3) a managerial focused data science graduate program curriculum


The objective of all three curriculums is to educate individuals to a strong level of job readiness in the field. Employability and marketability of graduating students is therefore a key consideration in all design choices.


This repositry mainly consists of codes for:

(1) Webscraping of Indeed, Analytics Vidya, Course era, University databases

(2) Using IBM NLU API for custom entity detection

(3) Job matching with Resume using Machine Learning Algorithms
